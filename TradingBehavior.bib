abstract = {We use data on Indian stock portfolios to show that return heterogeneity is the primary contributor to increasing inequality of wealth held in risky assets by Indian individual investors. Return heterogeneity increases wealth inequality through two main channels, both of which are related to the prevalence of undiversified accounts that own relatively few stocks. First, some undiversified portfolios randomly do well, while others randomly do poorly. Second, larger accounts diversify more effectively and thereby earn higher average log returns even though their average simple returns are no higher than those of smaller accounts.},

@article{Gervais2001,
abstract = {We develop a multi-period market model describing both the process by which traders learn about their ability and how a bias in this learning can create overconfident traders. A trader in our model initially does not know his own ability, that is, the probability that he will receive a valid signal in each period. He infers this ability from his successes and failures. In assessing his ability the trader takes too much credit for his successes, i.e. he weighs his successes more heavily than would a true Bayesian agent. This leads him to become overconfident. A trader's expected level of overconfidence increases in the early stages of his career. Then, with more experience, he comes to better recognize his own ability. An overconfident trader trades too aggressively, thereby increasing trading volume and market volatility while lowering his own expected profits. Though a greater number of past successes indicates greater probable ability, a more successful trader may actually have lower expected profits in the next period than a less successful trader due to his greater overconfidence. Since overconfidence is generated by success, overconfident traders are not the poorest traders. Their survival in the market is not threatened. Overconfidence does not make traders wealthier, but the process of becoming wealthy can make traders overconfident.},

abstract = {We develop an equilibrium model of learning by rational traders to reconcile several empirical regularities: Cross sectionally, most individual speculators lose money; large speculators outperform small speculators; past performance positively affects subsequent trade intensity; most new traders lose money and cease speculation; and performance shows persistence. Learning from trading generates substantial endogenous liquidity, reducing bid-ask spreads and the impact of exogenous liquidity shocks on asset prices, but amplifying the effects of real shocks. Introducing slightly overconfident traders increases bid-ask spreads, hurting all traders. Finally, behavioral theories cannot reconcile all of these empirical regularities.},

To do so, we develop a dynamic capital structure model in which firms face uncertainty regarding their ability to raise funds in credit markets and have to search for investors when seeking to adjust their capital structure. We provide a general analysis of shareholders' dynamic financing and default decisions, show when Markov perfect equilibria in financing and default barrier strategies exist, and when uniqueness can be achieved. We then use the model to generate a number of novel testable implications relating credit market frictions to target leverage, the pace and size of capital structure changes, creditor turnover, and the likelihood of default.},

abstract = {This paper analyses the phenomena of learning and experimentation in the context of a dynamic economic model which incorporates a Bayesian expectation revision mechanism. In this model, the individual (or firm) responds to new information as it is received, but he is not passive about the information he obtains. Indeed, he recognizes that his future expectations, and therefore his future decisions, will depend on the information which is acquired by observing the consequences of his present actions. He is also aware that the quality of information acquired from experience may be affected by the specific course of action followed in the present. In this model, individuals find it profitable to modify their behaviour as a means of improving the information on which future decisions are based. In deciding exactly how much experimentation to engage in, individuals weigh the benefits from more informed future decisions against the costs incurred because present experimental actions differ from those which would be optimal if learning from experience did not occur.},

To model this belief in the "Law of Small Numbers," I assume that a person exaggerates the likelihood that a short sequence of i.i.d. signals resembles the long-run rate at which those signals are generated. Such a person believes in the "gambler'S fallacy," thinking that early draws of one signal increase the odds of next drawing other signals. When uncertain about the rate, the person overinfers from short sequences of signals that the rate is more extreme than it is, and consequently infers that there is more variation in these rates among different sources than there is. Economic applications are discussed, such as how the model predicts that investors will believe in nonexistent variation in the quality of mutual-fund managers.},

abstract = {We use mutual fund manager data from the technology bubble to examine the hypothesis that inexperienced investors play a role in the formation of asset price bubbles. Using age as a proxy for managers' investment experience, we find that around the peak of the technology bubble, mutual funds run by younger managers are more heavily invested in technology stocks, relative to their style benchmarks, than their older colleagues. Furthermore, young managers, but not old managers, exhibit trend-chasing behavior in their technology stock investments. As a result, young managers increase their technology holdings during the run-up, and decrease them during the downturn. Both results are in line with the behavior of inexperienced investors in experimental asset markets. The economic significance of young managers' actions is amplified by large inflows into their funds prior to the peak in technology stock prices. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Glynn1995,
abstract = {In financial markets traders often protect their position from a significant decline by using a trailing stop. Assume the trader is long the market (owns the security). A trailing stop is an order to sell the security at the market, if the price of the security drops to the stop price. The stop price is always less than the market price when the stop is entered. As the price fluctuates, the stop is raised to remain a fixed distance from the maximum price at which the security trades. In this paper we consider two models for the price process: a discrete time random walk and continuous time Brownian motion, both with positive drift. For these price processes we compute the distribution, mean, and variance of the gain to the trader as well as the duration of the trade when a trailing stop strategy is used. Also discussed is the question of optimizing the distance from the current price to the stop. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Theoretical models predict that overconfident investors will trade more than rational investors. We directly test this hypothesis by correlating individual overconfidence scores with several measures of trading volume of individual investors. Approximately 3,000 online broker investors were asked to answer an internet questionnaire which was designed to measure various facets of overconfidence (miscalibration, volatility estimates, better than average effect). The measures of trading volume were calculated by the trades of 215 individual investors who answered the questionnaire. We find that investors who think that they are above average in terms of investment skills or past performance (but who did not have above average performance in the past) trade more. Measures of miscalibration are, contrary to theory, unrelated to measures of trading volume. This result is striking as theoretical models that incorporate overconfident investors mainly motivate this assumption by the calibration literature and model overconfidence as underestimation of the variance of signals. In connection with other recent findings, we conclude that the usual way of motivating and modeling overconfidence which is mainly based on the calibration literature has to be treated with caution. Moreover, our way of empirically evaluating behavioral finance models—the correlation of economic and psychological variables and the combination of psychometric measures of judgment biases (such as overconfidence scores) and field data'seems to be a promising way to better understand which psychological phenomena actually drive economic behavior.},

Without "physical delivery," strategies based on "corners" or "squeezes" are infeasible. However, uninformed investors still earn positive expected profits by establishing a futures position and then trading in the spot market to manipulate the spot price used to compute the cash settlement at delivery. We also show that as the number of manipulators grows, profits from manipulation fall to zero. However, even in the limit, manipulation still has a nontrivial impact on market liquidity. More broadly, we interpret manipulation as a form of endogenous "noise trading" which can arise in multiperiod security markets.},

These maximum likelihood based models can be compared, using readily available techniques such as the likelihood ratio test and the Akaike criterion. The neural network models are illustrated using data on the survival of men with prostatic carcinoma.

abstract = {Motivated by the industry practice of pairs trading, we study the optimal timing strategies for trading a mean-reverting price spread. An optimal double stopping problem is formulated to analyze the timing to start and subsequently liquidate the position subject to transaction costs. Modeling the price spread by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, we apply a probabilistic methodology and rigorously derive the optimal price intervals for market entry and exit. As an extension, we incorporate a stop-loss constraint to limit the maximum loss. We show that the entry region is characterized by a bounded price interval that lies strictly above the stop-loss level. As for the exit timing, a higher stop-loss level always implies a lower optimal take-profit level. Both analytical and numerical results are provided to illustrate the dependence of timing strategies on model parameters such as transaction cost and stop-loss level.},

The risk premiums are determined by the exposure to the market (myopic betas) and the future return on the efficient portfolio (non-myopic betas), which is identified nonparametrically from equilibrium. Non-myopic betas are priced in the cross-section of stocks, producing increasing and economically significant risk-return relation. In the model with funding constraints, low non-myopic beta stocks deliver higher risk-adjusted returns. Empirically, a betting against non-myopic beta portfolio generates superior performance relative to common factor models and is negatively correlated with the market betting against beta portfolio.},

abstract = {Nonparametric density estimation is a fundamental problem of statistics and data mining. Even though kernel density estimation is the most widely used method, its performance highly depends on the choice of the kernel bandwidth, and it can become computationally expensive for large data sets. We present an adaptive sparse-grid-based density estimation method which discretizes the estimated density function on basis functions centered at grid points rather than on kernels centered at the data points. Thus, the costs of evaluating the estimated density function are independent from the number of data points. We give details on how to estimate density functions on sparse grids and develop a cross validation technique for the parameter selection. We show numerical results to confirm that our sparse-grid-based method is well-suited for large data sets, and, finally, employ our method for the classification of astronomical objects to demonstrate that it is competitive to current kernel-based density estimation approaches with respect to classification accuracy and runtime.},

@article{Wade2004,
abstract = {In the 1870s the American economist Henry George remarked that 'the association of poverty with progress is the great enigma of our times'. Today the enigma is well on the way to being solved. World poverty and income inequality have both fallen during the past 20 years, thanks in large part to the third great wave of 'globalisation' (rising economic openness and integration of national economies). This, at least, is the claim of the neoliberal argument, which supports the optimism about globalisation that emanates from the pages of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Trade Organization (WTO), The Financial Times, The Economist and other organs of 'thinking for the world'. Leading theorist John Hicks considered introducing an assumption of increasing returns into economic theory in the late 1930s and drew back in alarm. 'It must be remembered that the threatened wreckage is that of the greater part of general equilibrium theory', he warned, because 'unless we can suppose ... that marginal costs generally increase with output at the point of equilibrium ... the basis on which economic laws can be constructed is shorn away'. The need for determinate mathematical solutions bent economics - as the aspiring universal science of human behaviour - away from the study of increasing returns, not for any reason to do with the real world but because increasing returns are difficult to treat mathematically. But the framework thus constructed also bolstered economists' normative faith in free markets and distrust of the state. Now this evidence on poverty and inequality - and quite a lot of other evidence as well - challenges the normative faith as well as the conceptual apparatus. Having indicated what is at stake I now summarise the earlier findings about levels and trends and then go on to talk about some of the bulldozer (not scalpel) causes. {\textcopyright} 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.},

The model is trained with the maximum likelihood method using mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The use of SGD enables rapid convergence and application to large datasets that do not fit in memory. The model is flexible, so that the baseline hazard rate and the effect of the input data on hazard probability can vary with follow-up time. It has been implemented in the Keras deep learning framework, and source code for the model and several examples is available online.

We model these exit times using competing risks models, which allow for a joint analysis of exit type and exit timing. The hazard rate for IPOs are clearly non-monotonic with respect to time. As time flows, VC-backed firms first exhibit an increased likelihood of exiting to an IPO. However, after having reached a plateau, non-exited investments have fewer possibilities of IPO exits as time increases. This sharply contrasts with trade sale exits, where the hazard rate is less time-varying.

abstract = {Economists and investment professionals have long been puzzled by the tendency of individual investors to sell the winners from their stock portfolio and to hold on to the losers. I analyze the daily trading records of 78,000 clients of a discount brokerage house over six years and document, surprisingly, that such behavior (known as the disposition effect) is concentrated primarily in large-cap stocks. Trades in stocks at the bottom 40 percent of the market capitalization distribution exhibit a reverse disposition effect: investors keep their winners and realize their losers. Moreover, the relationship between firm size and the disposition effect appears to be monotonic. The larger the market capitalization of the firm, the more likely people are to realize their gain and to hold on to their loss. This new evidence challenges the current view of the literature that the disposition effect is an implication of a prospect-theory type of individual preferences.    I examine different potential explanations for the size dependence of the disposition effect, such as margin calls being triggered more often by the more volatile small stocks, different trading styles in small stocks and large stocks and different behavior with regard to small and large gains and losses. My findings are consistent with a view that individual beliefs rather than preferences are generating the disposition effect.},

abstract = {Due to its enormous size and capital base, the insurance industry has the potential to play a key role in countering climate change. To this end, the major capital flows associated with its investment and underwriting businesses would need to be redirected towards carbon-neutral activities. Since insurance companies can be viewed as large portfolios consisting of financial risks (asset side) and underwriting risks (liability side), we suggest an asset pricing approach to detect carbon-intensive positions on their balance sheets. The framework should be accompanied by two simple policy changes to reinforce its effectiveness.},

The empirical evidence is consistent with this motive only if investors have very high levels of risk tolerance and equity returns are negatively correlated with domestic inflation. We then develop a model of international portfolio choice and equity market equilibrium that integrates inflation risk and deadweight costs. Using this model we estimate the levels of costs required to generate the observed home bias in portfolios consistent with different levels of risk aversion. For a level of risk aversion consistent with standard estimates of the domestic equity market risk premium these costs are about a few percent per annum greater than observable costs such as withholding taxes. Thus, the home bias cannot be explained by either inflation hedging or direct observable costs of international investment unless investors have very low levels of risk aversion.},

Two principal factors have contributed to this evolution: a body of evidence showing how psychological bias affects the behavior of economic actors; and an accumulation of evidence that is hard to reconcile with fully rational models of security market trading volumes and returns. In particular, asset markets exhibit trading volumes that are high, with individuals and asset managers trading aggressively, even when such trading results in high risk and low net returns. Moreover, asset prices display patterns of predictability that are difficult to reconcile with rational expectations-based theories of price formation. In this paper, we discuss the role of overconfidence as an explanation for these patterns.},

Our experiments were designed to see if subjects would exhibit disposition effects. Subjects bought and sold shares in six risky assets. Asset prices fluctuated in each period. Contrary to Bayesian optimization, subjects did tend to sell winners and keep losers. When the shares were automatically sold after each period, the disposition effect was greatly reduced.

Our findings are consistent with females tending to have better ability in the "theory of the mind", and hence are better at recognising patterns in the data with superior trading intuition. We further show that female investors prefer to purchases underpriced stocks and sell overpriced stocks based on the trading signal that the difference between contemporaneous price and moving averages over short-term, 4-week to long-term, 1-year. Our evidence suggests that it is possible to use the trading pattern of these smart female investors to anticipate market movements.

abstract = {Using data on the investments a large number of individual investors made through a discount broker from 1991 to 1996, we find that households exhibit a strong preference for local investments. We test whether this locality bias stems from information or from simple familiarity. The average household generates an additional annualized return of 3.2{\%} from its local holdings relative to its nonlocal holdings, suggesting that local investors can exploit local knowledge. Excess returns to investing locally are even larger among stocks not in the S{\&}P 500 index (firms for which information asymmetries between local and nonlocal investors may be largest).},

abstract = {In this paper, we analyze the investment patterns of a large number of clients of a major Israeli brokerage house during 1994. We compare the behavior of clients making independent investment decisions to that of investors whose accounts were managed by brokerage professionals. Our main objective is to investigate whether the disposition effect (i.e., the tendency to sell winners quicker than losers), demonstrated in the US only for individual investors, also holds for professional investors. This analysis is important, as accepted financial theory predicts that prices are determined mainly by decisions made by professionals. We show that both professional and independent investors exhibit the disposition effect, although the effect is stronger for independent investors. The second objective of our study is the comparison of trade frequency, volume and profitability between independent and professionally managed accounts. We believe that these comparisons not only provide insights of their own, but also help to put the differences in the disposition effect in a wider perspective. We demonstrate that professionally managed accounts were more diversified and that round trips were both less correlated with the market and slightly more profitable than those of independent accounts. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {We utilize seventeen years of comprehensive daily portfolio and trading data identified at the individual investor level, to analyze the relative trading performance of the entire universe of households, all domestic financial institutions and all foreign institutions in the Finnish market. We introduce a new methodology we dub the “holding-period-invariant” (HPI) portfolio approach. The conventional calendar-time portfolio approach imposes a heroic assumption that all investors mechanically realize (i.e., trade) their portfolio at specified intervals corresponding to an assumed horizon. By contrast, our methodology is free of such bias and allows for the endogenous nature of investment timing decisions made by numerous informed households (and, for that matter, domestic institutions). Adopting a random informationless trading benchmark, we find that the households who choose to trade for themselves are economically and statistically superior traders, achieving an impressive internal rate of return of 42.84{\%} p.a., or 0.0288{\%} of traded value, when foreign institutions are their exclusive counterparty. (Domestic institutions trading with foreigners do even better at 51.8{\%} p.a.). Our findings are contrary to some of the existing empirical literature on household investors derived from calendar-time portfolios. When we split households into informationally advantaged (i.e., located near Nokia) and disadvantaged, we find that while the former are the superior traders, both household groups continue to outperform foreign investors and Helsinki households outperform their domestic institutional rivals.},

Because of the overshoot problems associated with general jump diffusion processes, the double exponential jump diffusion process offers a rare case in which analytical solutions for the first passage times are feasible.

In the framework, the DL part automatically senses the dynamic market condition for informative feature learning. Then, the RL module interacts with deep representations and makes trading decisions to accumulate the ultimate rewards in an unknown environment. The learning system is implemented in a complex NN that exhibits both the deep and recurrent structures.

abstract = {This paper develops a new neural network architecture for modeling spatial distributions (i.e., distributions on R{\^{}}d) which is computationally efficient. The design of the architecture takes advantage of the specific structure of limit order books. The new architecture, which we refer to as a “spatial neural network”, yields a low-dimensional model of price movements deep into the limit order book, allowing more effective use of information from deep in the limit order book (i.e., many levels beyond the best bid and best ask). The spatial neural network models the joint distribution of the state of the limit order book at a future time conditional on the current state of the limit order book. The spatial neural network outperforms status quo models such as the naive empirical model, logistic regression (with nonlinear features), and a standard neural network architecture. Both neural networks strongly outperform the logistic regression model. Due to its more effective use of information deep in the limit order book, the spatial neural network especially outperforms the standard neural network in the tail of the distribution, which is important for risk management applications. The models are trained and tested on nearly 500 U.S. stocks. Techniques from deep learning such as dropout are employed to improve performance. Due to the significant computational challenges associated with the large amount of data, models are trained with a cluster of 50 GPUs. },

In contrast to previous research that has demonstrated the disposition effect by aggregating across investors, our main objective is to identify differences in the disposition bias across individuals and explain this in terms of underlying investor characteristics. Building on the findings in experimental economics and social psychology, we hypothesize that differences in investor literacy about financial markets and trading frequency are responsible in part for the variation in individual disposition effect. Using demographic and socioeconomic variables as proxies for investor literacy, we find empirical evidence that wealthier individuals and individuals employed in professional occupations exhibit a lower disposition effect. Consistent with experimental economics, trading frequency also tends to reduce the disposition effect. We provide guidelines for investment advisors, regulators, and investment communities to utilize our findings and help investors make better decisions.},

New ground is broken methodologically because all the propositions are justified by simulations of a rigorous (60-equation) model, making it possible to pin down exactly why the results come out as they do. One conclusion of the paper is that there is no such thing as a supply of money distinct from the money which agents wish to hold, or find themselves holding. This finding is inimical, possibly in the end lethal, to the way macroeconomics is currently taught as well as to the neoclassical paradigm itself.},

The superiority of the ANN is a surprising result, given that European-style equity options are the home ground of Black-Scholes, and suggests that ANNs may have an important role to play in pricing other options for which there is either no closed-form model, or the closed-form model is less successful than is Black-Scholes for equity options.},

Dumas (Rev. Financ.

We show that the answer depends on the risk aversions of the agents in the economy: the upper bound holds when all risk aversions are smaller than one, and the lower bound holds when all risk aversions are larger than one. The bounds almost never hold simultaneously. Furthermore, we prove these bounds for arbitrary assets.},

abstract = {Empirical studies have analyzed how investors trade and perform in the financial markets. The studies show that rational trading needs do not explain the excessive manner of trading shown by the investors. Theoretical models offer overconfidence as one of the explanations for irrational trading behavior. Overconfidence is a psychological trait, argued to cause the investors to misinterpret useful information, which leads to an increase in trading activity and hurts their performance. In this study we analyze over 1.5 million Finnish trading records from the beginning of 1995 to the end of 2010. We evaluate the differences in trading behavior between males and females and with investors of diverse ages. We find that men trade securities more frequently and with higher turnover than females. Consistently with our reference studies we find that the level of turnover decreases as the investors age. We also analyze the profitability effects of trading by calculating raw returns and abnormal returns. The abnormal returns are adjusted with a passive benchmark portfolio. Earlier studies show that the more active trading of males reduces their abnormal returns. Our abnormal return ratios do not support this finding. However, we find consistently that the raw returns are higher for females than males. Females also hold portfolios with lower volatility than males. Finally, we find consistently with the models of overconfidence by Odean (1998b) and Gervais and Odean (2001) that the trading skill seems to get better with experience. Older investors receive higher raw returns and trade less, resulting in lower portfolio turnover. The transition in trading behavior may be an outcome of learning.},

The information gathered is further shared at subsequent meetings, and so on. Equilibria exist in which agents search maximally until they acquire sufficient information precision and then search minimally. A tax whose proceeds are used to subsidize the costs of search improves information sharing and can, in some cases, increase welfare.

The framework places special emphasis on the effects of reading on cognitive development and on "bootstrapping" relationships involving reading.

Initially, we question whether investors' previous forecasting ability (inferred from prior purchases' subsequent risk-adjusted performance) affects their future trade profitability and activity. Indeed, as an investor's inferred ability increases, so does her ensuing trade profitability and intensity. Further, because additional investment experience allows more accurate ability inference, we posit that trading experience should help investors obtain better investment performance. Consistent with this hypothesis, not only do excess portfolio returns improve with account tenure, but we also find that trade quality (i.e., average raw and excess buy-minus-sell returns) significantly increases with experience (i.e., calendar time and account tenure). In sum, individual stock investors do learn, and they consequently adjust their behavior and thus effectively improve their investment performance.},

This framework includes other elements, namely mental accounting, regret aversion, self-control, and tax considerations. Second, we discuss evidence which suggests that tax considerations alone cannot explain the observed patterns of loss and gain realization, and that the patterns are consistent with a combined effect of tax considerations and the three other elements of our framework.

Using detailed trade data from two brokers, the authors document that investors are reluctant to repurchase stocks previously sold for a loss and stocks that have risen in price subsequent to a prior sale. The authors propose that this behavior reflects investors' emotional reactions to trading and their attempts to distance themselves from negative emotions (e.g., disappointment, regret). Investors are disappointed when they sell a stock for a loss and regret having ever purchased the stock; these negative emotions deter investors from later repurchasing stocks they sold for a loss. Having sold a stock, investors are disappointed if the stock continues to rise and regret having sold the stock in the first place; these negative emotions deter investors from repurchasing stocks that go up since being sold. Thus, investors engage in reinforcement learning by repurchasing stocks whose previous purchase resulted in positive emotions and avoiding stocks whose previous purchase resulted in negative emotions. {\textcopyright} 2011, American Marketing Association.},

First, we document that the portfolio returns of underdiversified investors are substantially more positively skewed than those of diversified investors. Second, we show that the apparent mean-variance inefficiency of underdiversified investors can be largely explained by the fact that investors sacrifice mean-variance efficiency for higher skewness exposure. Furthermore, we show that idiosyncratic skewness, and not just coskewness, can impact equilibrium prices. Third, the underdiversification of investors does not appear to be coincidentally related to skewness. Stocks most often selected by underdiversified investors have substantially higher average skewness-especially idiosyncratic skewness-than stocks most often selected by diversified investors.

abstract = {Medical practitioners use survival models to explore and understand the relationships between patients' covariates (e.g. clinical and genetic features) and the effectiveness of various treatment options. Standard survival models like the linear Cox proportional hazards model require extensive feature engineering or prior medical knowledge to model treatment interaction at an individual level. While nonlinear survival methods, such as neural networks and survival forests, can inherently model these high-level interaction terms, they have yet to be shown as effective treatment recommender systems. We introduce DeepSurv, a Cox proportional hazards deep neural network and state-of-the-art survival method for modeling interactions between a patient's covariates and treatment effectiveness in order to provide personalized treatment recommendations. We perform a number of experiments training DeepSurv on simulated and real survival data. We demonstrate that DeepSurv performs as well as or better than other state-of-the-art survival models and validate that DeepSurv successfully models increasingly complex relationships between a patient's covariates and their risk of failure. We then show how DeepSurv models the relationship between a patient's features and effectiveness of different treatment options to show how DeepSurv can be used to provide individual treatment recommendations. Finally, we train DeepSurv on real clinical studies to demonstrate how it's personalized treatment recommendations would increase the survival time of a set of patients. The predictive and modeling capabilities of DeepSurv will enable medical researchers to use deep neural networks as a tool in their exploration, understanding, and prediction of the effects of a patient's characteristics on their risk of failure.},

@article{Merton1968,
abstract = {This account of the Matthew effect is another small exercise in the psychosociological analysis of the workings of science as a social institution. The initial problem is transformed by a shift in theoretical perspective. As originally identified, the Matthew effect was construed in terms of enhancement of the position of already eminent scientists who are given disproportionate credit in cases of collaboration or of independent multiple discoveries. Its significance was thus confined to its implications for the reward system of science. By shifting the angle of vision, we note other possible kinds of consequences, this time for the communication system of science. The Matthew effect may serve to heighten the visibility of contributions to science by scientists of acknowledged standing and to reduce the visibility of contributions by authors who are less well known. We examine the psychosocial conditions and mechanisms underlying this effect and find a correlation between the redundancy function of multiple discoveries and the focalizing function of eminent men of sciencea function which is reinforced by the great value these men place upon finding basic problems and by their self-assurance. This self-assurance, which is partly inherent, partly the result of experiences and associations in creative scientific environments, and partly a result of later social validation of their position, encourages them to search out risky but important problems and to highlight the results of their inquiry. A macrosocial version of the Matthew principle is apparently involved in those processes of social selection that currently lead to the concentration of scientific resources and talent (50).},

abstract = {Combining survey responses and trading records of clients of a German retail broker, this paper examines some of the causes for the apparent failure to buy and hold a well-diversified portfolio. The subjective investor attributes gleaned from the survey help explain the variation in actual portfolio and trading choices. Self-reported risk aversion is the single most important determinant of both portfolio diversification and turnover; other things equal, investors who report being more risk tolerant hold less diversified portfolios and trade more aggressively. Less experienced investors similarly tend to churn poorly diversified portfolios. The effect of perceived knowledge on portfolio choice is less clear cut; holding other attributes constant, investors who think themselves knowledgeable about financial securities indeed hold better diversified portfolios, but those who think themselves more knowledgeable than the average investor churn their portfolios more.},

This paper develops an equilibrium model of decentralized markets that accommodates general market structures with coexisting exchanges. Decentralized markets can allocate risk among traders with different risk preferences more efficiently, thus realizing gains from trade that cannot be reproduced in centralized markets. Market decentralization always increases price impact. Yet, markets in which assets are traded in multiple exchanges, whether they are disjoint or intermediated, can give higher welfare than the centralized market with the same traders and assets. In decentralized markets, demand substitutability across assets is endogenous and heterogeneous among traders.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the dynamics of individual portfolios in a unique data set containing the disaggregated wealth of all households in Sweden. Between 1999 and 2002, we observe little aggregate rebalancing in the financial portfolio of participants. These patterns conceal strong household-level evidence of active rebalancing, which on average offsets about one-half of idiosyncratic passive variations in the risky asset share. Wealthy, educated investors with better diversified portfolios tend to rebalance more actively. We find some evidence that households rebalance toward a greater risky share as they become richer. We also study the decisions to trade individual assets. Households are more likely to fully sell directly held stocks if those stocks have performed well, and more likely to exit direct stockholding if their stock portfolios have performed well; but these relationships are much weaker for mutual funds, a pattern that is consistent with previous research on the disposition effect among direct stockholders and performance sensitivity among mutual fund investors. When households continue to hold individual assets, however, they rebalance both stocks and mutual funds to offset about one-sixth of the passive variations in individual asset shares. Households rebalance primarily by adjusting purchases of risky assets if their risky portfolios have performed poorly, and by adjusting both fund purchases and full sales of stocks if their risky portfolios have performed well. Finally, the tendency for households to fully sell winning stocks is weaker for wealthy investors with diversified portfolios of individual stocks. {\textcopyright} 2009 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

When the investor is subject to a lower bound on net return, he/she is forced to reduce the total risk of his/her portfolio after a loss. In this case, he/she faces a tradeoff of either paying the transaction costs and deleveraging or keeping his/her current position in the illiquid instrument and hedging away some of the risk while keeping the residual, unhedgeable risk on his/her balance sheet. We explicitly characterize this tradeoff and study its dependence on asset characteristics. In particular, we show that higher alpha and lower beta typically widen the no-trading zone, while the impact of volatility is ambiguous.},

@article{Odean1999,
abstract = {This paper takes a first step towards demonstrating that overall trading volume in equity markets is excessive, by showing that it is excessive for a particular group of investors: those with discount brokerage accounts. One possible cause of excessive trading is overconfidence. Overconfident investors will trade too frequently, that is, the gains overconfident investors realize through trade will be less than they anticipate and may not even offset the costs of trading. By analyzing trading records for 10,000 accounts at a large discount brokerage house, I test whether the securities these investors purchase outperform those they sell by enough to cover the costs of trading. I find the surprising result that, on average, the securities they purchase actually underperform those they sell. This is the case even when trading is not apparently motivated by liquidity demands, tax-loss selling, portfolio rebalancing, or a move to lower-risk securities. I examine return patterns before and after transactions. Return patterns before purchases and sales can be explained by the difficulty of the search for securities to buy, investors' tendency to let their attention be directed by outside sources, the disposition effect, and investors' reluctance to sell short.},

@incollection{Peskir2006,
abstract = {In the end of Chapter I we have seen that the optimal stopping problem for a Markov process X with the value function V is equivalent to the problem of finding the smallest superharmonic function V which dominates the gain function G on the state space E. In this case, moreover, the first entry time of X into the stopping set D = {\{}V = G{\}} is optimal. This yields the following representation: V (x) = E x G(X $\tau$D) (1) for x ∈ E. Due to the Markovian structure of X , any function of the form (1) is intimately related to a deterministic equation which governs X in mean (parabolic/elliptic PDEs [partial differential equations] when X is continuous, or more general PIDEs [partial integro-differential equations] when X has jumps). The main purpose of the present chapter is to unveil and describe the previous connection. This leads to differential or integro-differential equations which the function V solves. Since the optimal stopping set D is unknown and has to be determined among all possible candidate sets D in (1), it is clear that this connection and the equations obtained play a fundamental role in search for the solution to the problem. It is worthwhile to recall that when X is a Markov chain the analogous problems have been considered in Subsection 4.2 in the context of discrete-time "potential theory". In order to focus on the equations only, and how these equations actually follow from the Markovian structure, we will adopt a formal point of view in the sequel where everything by definition is assumed to be sufficiently regular and valid as needed to make the given calculations possible. Most of the time such a set of sufficient conditions is easily specified. Sometimes, however, it may be more challenging to determine such sufficient conditions precisely. In any case, we will make use of the facts exposed in the present chapter mostly in a suggestive way throughout the monograph.},

The behavioural finance literature suggests four main factors that influence investment behaviour: overconfidence, risk tolerance, self-monitoring and social influence. Adopting this approach, a cluster analysis of data from a representative survey of 345 investors in Greece identified three main segments of investors: high profile investors (a high degree of overconfidence, risk tolerance, self-monitoring and social influence), moderate profile investors (a moderate level of overconfidence, risk tolerance, self-monitoring and social influence) and low profile investors (a low degree of overconfidence, risk tolerance, self-monitoring and social influence). The major finding of the analysis shows that the higher the investors' profile, the higher the performance of these investors on stock trading. The results will expand investors' knowledge about the financial decision-making process and trading behaviour.},
